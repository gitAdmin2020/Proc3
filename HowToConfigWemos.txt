You need a WEMOS card or ESP32 with Arduino Board and Arduino IDE to load scatches for this example.

1. Download Arduino IDE from here - https://arduino.cc

2. Open Arduino IDE properties and in the new window insert this link:

http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

into the Additional link for Boards' Manager section

3. Then open the Tools menu and choose Board Manager in the Board submenu.

4. Type WEMOS in the search string of the Board Manager Window and install ESP8266 and ESP8266 Community drivers.

5. The Last step is going back to Tools Menu and selecting your board in the submenu Boards. In my case, it was LOLIN (WEMOS R1 D2)
